MapCutr is a fork of MapTiler ,I only changed the name ,there are currently no new features added or improved !

But what is a MapTiler ?
To keep it simple: ItÂ´s a application which tiles a huge image (like a map) in smaller tiles and generates a HTML File to view it in your browser.

##Install it
Look in the wiki there -> https://github.com/stromberger/mapCutr/wiki
